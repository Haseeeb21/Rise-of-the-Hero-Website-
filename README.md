## Summary:
This project is based on a specific game website. On this website I am going to elaborate the theme of the game, the attribute of the characters that were used in the game and attributes of weapons that were used. 
All these things will come under different categories like a character in the character category and weapons in weapon one. 

There are 6 webpages in this website, from each page we can navigate to any of the other pages of the website. 
First is the home page (index.html) which shows the theme and name of the game include the full name of the hero and the enemy lord, and other buttons from where we can move to other webpages. 

The character page includes little introductions of the characters in the game. Such as, the hero, the enemies (Minions)and the enemy boss (Demon Lord).
The team page includes the details, specialization and email address of the team members which were included in development the game. 
The contact us webpage includes the user to get in touch, suggest or ask queries from the game developers. 

The download webpage includes the details of the game including the screen shots of the game and required specifications for the game to be downloaded and diverts the users to download link of the game.
